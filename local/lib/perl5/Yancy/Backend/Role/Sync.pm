# ABSTRACT: A role to give a synchronous backend useful Promises methods

#pod =head1 SYNOPSIS
#pod
#pod     package Yancy::Backend::SyncOnly;
#pod     with 'Yancy::Backend::Role::Sync';
#pod
#pod     package main;
#pod     my $be = Yancy::Backend::SyncOnly->new;
#pod     my $promise = $be->create_p( \%item );
#pod
#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod This role implements C<list_p>, C<get_p>, C<set_p>, C<delete_p>, and
#pod C<create_p> methods that return L<Mojo::Promise> objects for synchronous
#pod backends. This does not make the backend asynchronous: The original,
#pod synchronous method is called and a promise object created from the
#pod result. The promise is then returned already fulfilled.

Yancy::Backend::Role::Sync - A role to give a synchronous backend useful Promises methods

=head1 VERSION

version 1.066

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Yancy::Backend::SyncOnly;
    with 'Yancy::Backend::Role::Sync';

    package main;
    my $be = Yancy::Backend::SyncOnly->new;
    my $promise = $be->create_p( \%item );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role implements C<list_p>, C<get_p>, C<set_p>, C<delete_p>, and
C<create_p> methods that return L<Mojo::Promise> objects for synchronous
backends. This does not make the backend asynchronous: The original,
synchronous method is called and a promise object created from the
result. The promise is then returned already fulfilled.
